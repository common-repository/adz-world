<p>The adz.world plugin not only enables you to run your website like a TV station, it also connects you with an ad network that helps you  create an enjoyable, mutually acceptable, profitable experience for you and your site visitors. </p>
<p>Here are our always up-front <em>super-transparent</em> terms for use of this plugin.</p>
<h2>Terms of Service And Privacy Compliance Summary</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Use: </strong>There's something called "phoning home" in the Worpress space &amp; it means that the plugin contacts a database off your site. In order for us to be able to help you create a healthy environment of Advertising Awesomeness, we need you to agree that our plugin will "phone home." It is literally technically necessary for us to serve your adz from our server, so that we can provide our service to you. Therefore, to use our software, you must agree to let our plugin store your advertisemens on our server, so that we can serve them to you.</li>
  <li> <strong>Results &amp; Liability: </strong>The software is &quot;as is,&quot; results may vary &amp; all that gas. We have had super-high-level coders working on the plugin. But really, you gotta manage your website on your own &amp; you accept full responsibility for your own actions. If a plugin conflict arises with our plugin, which should be super unlikely, that's just the nature of today's Web. Let us know, we'll do our best to correct things, but the plugin is delivered to you &quot;as is.&quot; </li>
  <li><strong>Support:</strong> Our paid version gives you access to technical support. The free version is supported, at our leisure, at <a href="https://wordpress.org/">https://wordpress.org/</a></li>
  <li><strong>Money: </strong>Using the free version of our plugin, you share adz rotation placements with our network.  You receive the commissions from purchases made from the adz you've published, and the adz.world network receives the commissions from its adz. So, instead of requiring payment, in the free version, we share adz rotation space. In the paid version of the plugin,  you, as the Publisher, have precise control over the serving of Publisher, Network, and Visitor Adz.  &quot;Network Wide&quot; adz are automatic in the free version of the plugin, and they give our network the ability to serve high-paying adz to the users of our plugin. In the paid version, you can turn them on or off. Results will vary. </li>
  <li><strong>Mission: </strong>This plugin falls under the philosophical concept of &quot;The Age of Accordance,&quot; which is a book about what the 22nd century could look like, if humanity takes certain healthy steps -- now. In an Age of Accordance, permission-based advertising is possible, but surveillance-based advertising, is not. In an Age of Accordance - you are  asked what you would like - and you cannot be spied upon. For that reason, web users can configure their adz preferences - to receive adz for products they actually want :-) </li>
  <li><strong>Protection: </strong>Have you read the terms of service statements of giants like Amazon, Google, YouTube, or FaceBook? It's like they empower you but disampower you &amp; claim to protect you but don't really protect you &amp; claim everything yet have no liability and can do anything, etc. Well, apparently, that's what you gotta do to survive online nowadayz. So, we do the same thing. Our stipulations are explained in our Detailed Terms of Service and Data Protection Compliance Mandate, and we retain the option to retroactively modify our policies so that you cannot destroy us. You may not abuse or seek to destroy or malign our service. You may not use it maliciously to seek to frame our business into lawsuits, criminal activity, or wrongdoing. The goal of this software is to expedite the dawn of an age where mutual consent becomes the norm.  </li>
  <li><strong>Detailed Terms: </strong> To gain any form of relationship, contact, or engegement with the adz.world team -- or to use any adz.world software, service, information or products, you agree to our <a href="http://adz.world/bureaucracy/detailed-terms-of-service-and-data-protection-compliance-mandate/">Detailed Terms of Service and Data Protection Compliance Mandate</a>. Because we hold ourselves to the  values of an authentic &quot;Age of Accordance,&quot; our data protection mandate offers more protections for individual data than the GDPR itself. We're really riding the first wave of something something healthy, profitable, and completely new -- so enjoy!</li>
